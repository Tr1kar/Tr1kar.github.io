My name is Alex, and I'm a self-described "person of broad interests"

- I'm a **physicist**. I got my PhD in theoretical physics, specifically nonlinear optics. I specialize in nonlinear fiber optics, but my interests include photonics, nonlinear optics, quantum optics, nanotechnology and much-much more.
- I'm a **data scientist**. I'm currently re-qualifying to become machine learning engineer and/or data scientist.
- I'm a **storyteller**. I have a dream of becoming a screenwriter or narrative designer. So far, my creative will goes into my 10+ years of experience with tabletop RPGs, as player and gamemaster.
- I'm an **explorer of mind**. I am interested in psychology, philosophy and different manners of self-development. I've been through coaching, therapy, ADHD diagnosis - and I've come out feeling much better afterwards.
